# Advanced Machine Learning Lab Series: Transfer Learning - Notebook 1 üß†üöÄ

Welcome to the first lab in the **Advanced Machine Learning** series! This notebook introduces the exciting concept of **Transfer Learning**, an essential tool for efficiently training models with limited data. As a student in this advanced course, you are about to embark on a journey that explores how to leverage pre-trained models to solve challenging problems without needing massive datasets from scratch. Let‚Äôs dive in!

### üìå **Lab Goal**
The objective of this notebook is to help you understand and implement **transfer learning** to train a classification model on a **small custom dataset** by using **pre-trained weights**. Specifically, you will:

1. **Learn how to utilize a large pre-trained model** to make better predictions on a new, smaller dataset.
2. **Explore different strategies for fine-tuning** the model and identify the best approach to achieve high performance on the target task.
3. **Experiment with freezing layers** and observe the effect it has on training and generalization.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Lab Overview: How It's Done**
Here's what you'll accomplish step-by-step:

1. **Loading a Pre-trained Model:**
   - We will start by loading a **pre-trained neural network** (like ResNet or VGG), which has been trained on a massive dataset, such as ImageNet. This model already knows a lot about general image features.

2. **Fine-Tuning the Model:**
   - You will learn to **freeze certain layers** and modify others to adapt the model to a new classification task. By doing this, we can retain the useful features the model has learned while fine-tuning it for the new target dataset.
   - Different **freezing strategies** will be tried to find the optimal balance for this task. You'll see how freezing too many layers can limit adaptability, while freezing too few can lead to overfitting.

3. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - The target dataset for this lab is a subset of CIFAR-100, specifically focusing on the "reptiles" category. We will use **data augmentation** and **early stopping** to improve our model's performance.
   - You will train the model and evaluate it on the target dataset, using metrics like **accuracy** and **loss curves** to analyze performance.

### üåü **Why Transfer Learning?**
Transfer learning is a game-changer in machine learning. Instead of starting from scratch, transfer learning allows you to stand on the shoulders of giants and leverage pre-existing knowledge. This approach significantly **reduces training time**, **improves accuracy**, and **solves complex problems** even when you have a small dataset.

In this lab, you'll see how transfer learning boosted the performance from **54% to 68%** compared to a baseline approach without pre-training. This significant improvement was achieved by leveraging pre-trained models‚Äîillustrating the power of data-centric approaches and highlighting that, sometimes, the problem isn't the model but the data itself.

### üí° **Key Learnings**
- How to load and use pre-trained models from popular deep learning libraries.
- How to **freeze and unfreeze** different parts of the network and understand the impact.
- Techniques to fine-tune and adapt a pre-trained model for a specific dataset.
- Evaluating models through **validation accuracy** and understanding concepts like **overfitting** and **generalization**.

### üîç **Insights from the Lab Report**
Based on the practical experiments carried out in this lab:

1. **Baseline vs. Transfer Learning:**
   - Training from scratch led to a validation accuracy of about **54%** due to overfitting on the small target dataset.
   - With transfer learning (pre-training on CIFAR-10), the validation accuracy improved to **68%**, indicating better generalization thanks to the pre-learned features.

2. **Freezing Strategies:**
   - Fine-tuning **10 out of 12 layers** provided the best balance, with a validation accuracy plateauing at **~66%**. This showed that retaining most of the pre-trained features while allowing some flexibility was optimal for this task.
   - **Freezing too few layers** (e.g., 2/12) restricted adaptability, while **fine-tuning all layers** led to overfitting. The sweet spot lay in careful balance.

### üîß **Technologies Used**
- **Python** üêç for scripting and automation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** for building, fine-tuning, and training the model.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** for data analysis and visualizing model performance.

### üöÄ **Next Steps in the Lab Series**
This is just the beginning of your journey through **Advanced Machine Learning**! In the upcoming labs, you'll explore deeper into techniques like **self-supervised learning**, **meta-learning**, and **knowledge distillation**. Each notebook builds on the previous ones, so mastering transfer learning will set a strong foundation for what's to come.
